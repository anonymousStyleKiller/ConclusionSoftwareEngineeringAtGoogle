<h1> O'REILLY </h1>
<h2> Software Engineering At Google</h2> 

<br/>
<i>
This repository contains the main conclusions of the book "Software Engineering At Google"
<br/>
I actually thankful Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck, and Hyrum Wright for this amazing book.
<br/>
The main idea of this repository to help other developers to get conclusions of the book.
I obstinately recommend reading the whole book.

<h3>Part 1. Thesis</h3>
<h4>Chapter 1. What Is Software Engineering?</h4>

<ul>
<li>“Software engineering” differs from “programming” in dimensionality: programming is about producing code. Software engineering extends that to include the
maintenance of that code for its useful life span.</li>
<li>There is a factor of at least 100,000 times between the life spans of short-lived
code and long-lived code. It is silly to assume that the same best practices apply
universally on both ends of that spectrum.</li>
<li>Software is sustainable when, for the expected life span of the code, we are capable of responding to changes in dependencies, technology, or product requirements.
We may choose to not change things, but we need to be capable.</li>
<li>Hyrum’s Law: with a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter
what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be
depended on by somebody.</li>
<li>Every task your organization has to do repeatedly should be scalable (linear or
better) in terms of human input. Policies are a wonderful tool for making process
scalable.</li>
<li>Expertise pays off particularly well when combined with economies of scale.</li>
<li>“Because I said so” is a terrible reason to do things.</li>
<li>Being data driven is a good start, but in reality, most decisions are based on a mix
of data, assumption, precedent, and argument. It’s best when objective data
makes up the majority of those inputs, but it can rarely be all of them.</li>
<li>Being data driven over time implies the need to change directions when the data
changes (or when assumptions are dispelled). Mistakes or revised plans are inevitable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 2. Culture</h3>
<h4>Chapter 2. How to Work Well on Teams?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Be aware of the trade-offs of working in isolation.</li>
<li>Acknowledge the amount of time that you and your team spend communicating
and in interpersonal conflict. A small investment in understanding personalities
and working styles of yourself and others can go a long way toward improving
productivity.</li>
<li>If you want to work effectively with a team or a large organization, be aware of
your preferred working style and that of others.</li>
</ul>
